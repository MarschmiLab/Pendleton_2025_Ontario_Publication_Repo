This directory contains the data and code for the first manuscript coming out of the 2023 Ontario CSMI sampling trip. Herein, I amplified the 16S V4 region for May and September samples across Lake Ontario (and over three depths). Note, raw sequencing files and flow cytometry .fcs files are not present within this repo, though can be downloaded from SRA (PRJNA1212049) and FlowRepository (FR-FCM-Z8SJ), respectively. The analysis folder contains .Rmd files wherein I analyze the data and produce figures, and the knitted .md and .html outputs. Note that html outputs won't display in Github - clone this repo onto your device and open from them. The data folder holds exports (and inputs) of each step in the analysis pipeline. Large outputs may not be present (check the .gitignore), but the code to produce them is present. The code folder holds stand-alone R scripts that either load functions or plotting aesthetics. The figures folder holds exported figures.
