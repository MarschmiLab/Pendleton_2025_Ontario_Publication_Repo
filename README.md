This directory contains the data and code for the first manuscript coming out of the AAH_ONT_2023 sampling trip. Herein, I amplified the 16S V4 region for May and September samples across Lake Ontario (and over three depths). Note, raw sequencing files are not present within this repo, but are held on the remote server as sym links to lab_data. The data folder holds exports (and inputs) of each step in the analysis pipeline and several command line tools. The analysis folder holds .Rmd and .html files produced during analysis. The code folder holds stand-alone bash or R scripts, that either load functions, plotting aesthetics, or were used to download data in bulk. The library_prep folder holds information produced as I prepared my libraries, mostly relevant to notes in my lab notebook. The figures folder holds exported figures. The conferences folder holds conference abstracts and presentations (though presentations are not pushed to Github). Finally, the writing folder holds the manuscript and its references.
